# Hex IP Toolkit
Hex IP Toolkit is a small tool that I've written to convert normal IP addresses to hexadecimal equivalents and vice versa.

## Why?
Developed to support an automatic installation infrastructure powered by PXEBoot, syslinux and Kickstart and served good for a long time.

## How to use?
Just pass an IP address as an argument. It'll be converted to hex or decimal according to input format. It can also link to syslinux files. Run with -h to see its help.
